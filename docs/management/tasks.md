# Tasks

Tasks can be configured under *Tasks* in the management menu in the navigation bar.

> *Screenshot of the tasks management interface*

On the left-hand side is the main display of all the tasks available in this installation of RDMO. Tasks show their key, title and the text describing the task. On the right side of each tasks panel, icons indicate ways to interact the element. The following options are available:

* **Update** (![](../_static/img/icons/update.png)) a task to change its properties.
* **Copy** (![](../_static/img/icons/copy.png)) a task. This will open a modal to set a new key.
* **Update conditions** (![](../_static/img/icons/conditions.png)) of a task. A task will only be shown to the user, if all of its conditions are evaluated `True`. The conditions themselves are configured in [the conditions management](../management/conditions.html).
* **Update the time frame** (![](../_static/img/icons/timeframe.png)) of a task. The time frame is constructed from one or two dates from the user's answers. This allows for tasks about a specific deadline or special period.
* **Export** (![](../_static/img/icons/export.png)) a task as XML.
* **Delete** (![](../_static/img/icons/delete.png)) a task. **This action cannot be undone!**

The sidebar on the right-hand side shows additional interface items:

* **Filter** filters the view according to a user given string or a given URI prefix.
* **Options** offers additional operations:
  * Create a new task
* **Export** exports the conditions to one of the displayed formats. While the textual formats are mainly for presentation purposes, the XML export can be used to transfer the tasks to a different installation of RDMO.

Tasks have different properties to control their behavior. As described in [the introduction](index.html), all elements have an URI prefix, a key, and an internal comment only to be seen by other managers of the RDMO installation. In addition, you can edit the parameters below:
